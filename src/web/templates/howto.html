    <p class="page-subtitle">A text adventure played over radio. Five minutes a day. Thirty days an epoch. No internet required.</p>
  </div>

  {# ═══ WHAT IS THIS ═══ #}
  <div class="divider">What is meshMUD</div>

  <p class="prose">meshMUD is a multiplayer text adventure that runs over <strong>Meshtastic</strong> — a long-range radio mesh network. There is no internet connection, no app store, no account creation. You play by sending short text messages from your Meshtastic node. The game responds. Everything happens in 175 characters or less.</p>

  <p class="prose">It plays like the BBS door games of the early '90s — <em class="place">Legend of the Red Dragon</em>, <em class="place">TradeWars 2002</em> — adapted for radio. Short daily sessions. Asynchronous multiplayer. A shared world where you see evidence of other players without needing to be online at the same time. A dungeon that resets every 30 days.</p>

  <p class="prose">You don't need to be a gamer. You don't need to be fast. You need a Meshtastic radio and five minutes.</p>

  <div class="callout ember">
    <div class="callout-label">The basics</div>
    <p class="prose">You wake up in a tavern called <em class="place">The Last Ember</em>. Below it is a dungeon that changes every 30 days. You explore it, fight monsters, find secrets, and help other players push deeper — all by typing short commands over your radio. When the 30 days end, the dungeon resets. Your character persists. The stories stay.</p>
  </div>

  {# ═══ GETTING STARTED ═══ #}
  <div class="divider">Getting Started</div>

  <p class="prose">If your mesh network is running meshMUD, the game server listens for direct messages from any node. Send it a DM and it responds. That's it.</p>

  <p class="prose">Three stats govern everything: <strong>POW</strong> (offense), <strong>DEF</strong> (survivability), and <strong>SPD</strong> (evasion, initiative, spellcasting). Each class leans into one. You earn 2 stat points per level to allocate however you want — that's where your build takes shape.</p>

  {# ═══ A TYPICAL DAY ═══ #}
  <div class="divider">A Typical Day</div>

  <p class="prose">A session takes <strong>five to fifteen minutes</strong>. You get 8 movement actions per day — enough to explore several rooms and make real progress. Combat is free, so you can fight as much as you want. Town actions are always free.</p>

  {# ═══ THE TOWN ═══ #}
  <div class="divider">The Last Ember — Your Town</div>

  <p class="prose">The tavern is the one room that never changes. Epochs wipe the dungeon, reshuffle everything, reshape the world — but <em class="place">The Last Ember</em> stays. Same bar. Same people. Same lanterns that burn without oil and nobody questions anymore.</p>

  <p class="prose">Four people live here. They remember you across every wipe.</p>

      <div class="npc-guide-desc">Sits in the same corner. Knows things about the dungeon that change each epoch — lore, connections, what the symbols mean. Speaks in fragments because that's how the information comes to her. Pay attention to her exact words. Players who dismiss her as flavor text miss half the game.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  {# ═══ THE DUNGEON ═══ #}
  <div class="divider">The Dungeon</div>

  <p class="prose">Four floors. Each one deeper, harder, and stranger than the last. Monsters get meaner. Secrets get subtler. The rooms change every epoch but the structure holds — floor one is where you learn, floor four is where legends are made.</p>

  <p class="prose">You carry three pieces of gear: a <strong>weapon</strong>, <strong>armor</strong>, and a <strong>trinket</strong>. The trinket is the wildcard — it might grant a passive ability, boost an unexpected stat, or do something no other slot can. Six tiers of gear across the dungeon. The best stuff doesn't come from shops.</p>

  <div class="callout frost">
    <div class="callout-label">Death</div>
    <p class="prose">Death costs you all the gold you're carrying. Not your gear. Not your level. Just your gold. The question is always the same: do you bank it before you go in, or carry it and risk losing everything? The dungeon teaches you the answer. Usually the hard way.</p>
  </div>

  {# ═══ MULTIPLAYER ═══ #}
  <div class="divider">Playing Together</div>

  <p class="prose">meshMUD is <strong>asynchronous multiplayer</strong>. You don't need to be online at the same time as anyone else. You see other players through what they leave behind — messages scratched on dungeon walls, bounty progress that wasn't there yesterday, broadcasts announcing who found what and who fell where.</p>

  <div class="tip-strip">
    <div class="tip-card">
      <div class="tip-card-label">Bounties</div>
      <div class="tip-card-text">Shared objectives with communal HP pools. You chip away at a target over days. Everyone who contributes shares the reward when it falls.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="tip-card">
      <div class="tip-card-label">Messages</div>
      <div class="tip-card-text">Leave 15-character notes in dungeon rooms for others to find. Warnings, tips, coordinates. Dark Souls soapstone, over LoRa.</div>

    <div class="tip-card">
      <div class="tip-card-label">Mail</div>
      <div class="tip-card-text">Send direct messages to specific players through the barkeep. Coordinate strategy, share secrets, warn someone about what's ahead.</div>

    <div class="tip-card">
      <div class="tip-card-label">Broadcasts</div>
      <div class="tip-card-text">Major events announce to the whole mesh. Boss kills, rare finds, deaths, front line changes. The world narrates itself.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="prose">There is no PvP. All competition runs through leaderboards, bounty races, and endgame objectives. On a small mesh network where everyone knows each other, cooperation is the game.</p>

  {# ═══ EPOCHS ═══ #}
  <div class="divider">The 30-Day Epoch</div>

  <p class="prose">Every 30 days, the dungeon resets. New rooms, new monsters, new secrets, new narrative. Your character keeps their name and their history, but gear and gold start fresh. Each epoch has an <strong>endgame mode</strong> — a shared objective the whole server works toward. On day 30, players vote on the next epoch's mode.</p>

  <div class="callout gold">
    <div class="callout-label">Three endgame modes</div>
    <p class="prose"><strong>Hold the Line</strong> — the dungeon regenerates rooms. Push the front line deeper, establish checkpoints that lock in progress. The whole server descends together.</p>
    <p class="prose"><strong>Raid Boss</strong> — a massive enemy with thousands of HP squats on the lowest floor. The server chips away over days. Discover its weaknesses. Coordinate the kill.</p>
    <p class="prose"><strong>Retrieve &amp; Escape</strong> — an artifact on floor four. Grab it, carry it to the surface. Something unkillable chases the carrier. Other players clear the path, block the pursuer, relay the objective hand-to-hand.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="prose">On day 15, the <strong>Breach</strong> opens — a surprise mini-zone between floors two and three with its own challenge, its own loot, and its own secrets. You don't know what's inside until it opens.</p>

  {# ═══ SECRETS ═══ #}
  <div class="divider">Secrets &amp; Discovery</div>

  <p class="prose">Twenty secrets hide in the dungeon each epoch. Some are behind walls that need a strong arm to break. Some are puzzles spread across multiple rooms. Some are hidden in things <span class="npc-name" data-npc="whisper" role="button" tabindex="0">Whisper</span> says that nobody thinks to write down. Finding them isn't required — but every secret you uncover gives a real mechanical advantage, and some of them benefit the entire server.</p>

  <p class="prose"><strong>Read the room descriptions carefully.</strong> The dungeon tells you where its secrets are. It just doesn't tell you plainly.</p>

  {# ═══ COMMANDS ═══ #}
  <div class="divider">Quick Command Reference</div>

  <p class="prose">Every command fits in a short message. Most have single-letter shortcuts. New commands unlock as you level up — the game teaches you as you go.</p>

  <div class="divider"><span class="npc-name" data-npc="grist" role="button" tabindex="0">Grist</span>'s Advice for the New Arrival</div>

  <div class="callout ember">
    <div class="callout-label">Things nobody tells you</div>
    <p class="prose"><strong>Bank before you descend.</strong> Death takes everything you're carrying. Not your gear, not your level — just your gold. The bank is free. Use it.</p>
    <p class="prose"><strong>Visit <span class="npc-name" data-npc="grist" role="button" tabindex="0">Grist</span> every session.</strong> His recap costs nothing and tells you everything you missed. The bounty board is there too. Five seconds of reading saves you from walking into something that killed Sable yesterday.</p>
    <p class="prose"><strong>Leave messages.</strong> A 15-character note in a dangerous room saves someone's life tomorrow. This is a small network. Help each other.</p>
    <p class="prose"><strong>Read room descriptions.</strong> The dungeon hides things in plain sight. If the text mentions scratches on a wall, there's a reason. If <span class="npc-name" data-npc="whisper" role="button" tabindex="0">Whisper</span> mumbles about the eastern branch, there's a reason. The game rewards attention.</p>
    <p class="prose"><strong>You don't have to explore everything.</strong> Eight moves is enough for a good day, not enough for a reckless one. Combat is free, but every step costs. Know when to push deeper and when to RETURN to town.</p>
    <p class="prose"><strong>Bard tokens accrue whether you log in or not.</strong> One per day, cap at five. Spend them at the barkeep for things gold can't buy — hints, buffs, intel. A patient player who saves five tokens gets information that changes everything.</p>
