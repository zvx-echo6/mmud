# The Darkcragg Depths — Worldbuilding Guide

## The Legend: Oryn, Sola, and Malcor

Three figures shaped the Darkcragg before recorded history.

**Oryn the Builder** carved the Depths from raw stone. The halls, the pillars, the impossible geometry of four descending floors — all Oryn's hands. Oryn is referenced in carvings, tool marks, and architectural features throughout the dungeon. The Builder is never described as good or evil — just relentless. Oryn built because building was all Oryn knew how to do.

**Sola the Light** illuminated what Oryn built. The lanterns in the Last Ember, the bioluminescence of Floor 2, the lava veins of Floor 3 — all echoes of Sola's presence. Sola is warmth, visibility, safety. Where Sola's influence remains, things are navigable. Where it has faded, things go wrong. Sola is referenced through light metaphors: "the light fades," "Sola's reach grows thin."

**Malcor the One Below** is what the Depths were built to contain. Malcor is never fully described — only referenced through absence, pressure, and wrongness. The Void Reach (Floor 4) is where Malcor's influence is strongest. The Breach is Malcor stirring. The epoch cycle is the dungeon's attempt to reset and reseal whatever Malcor represents. Malcor is not a monster to be fought — Malcor is a condition the dungeon exists to suppress.

### The Cycle

The Darkcragg resets every 30 days (the epoch) because it must. The dungeon is a living seal. When Malcor's influence accumulates — monsters grow stronger, the Breach opens, the deep floors become unstable — the Darkcragg wipes itself and starts over. The NPCs remember across epochs. The dungeon does not. This is by design. The seal must hold.

Each epoch, the seal weakens slightly. The Breach opens earlier. The monsters are stranger. The NPCs notice but can't explain it. This is the long arc — not implemented mechanically yet, but present in NPC voice and atmospheric flavor.

## Floor Identity

Each floor reflects one aspect of the legend.

### Floor 1: The Sunken Halls (Oryn's Foundation)
The Builder's work, decayed. Stone corridors, dripping water, collapsed architecture. This floor feels *constructed* — it had purpose once. Tool marks, dry fountains, iron rings. The decay is age, not malice. Oryn's hands are visible in every wall.

**NPC knowledge:** Grist knows the Halls as "where it all started." Torval notes that iron from Floor 1 is the most reliable — "Oryn built to last." Whisper sees the Builder's marks and reads them like a language.

### Floor 2: The Fungal Depths (Sola's Echo)
Bioluminescence — the last trace of Sola's light, twisted into something organic. The fungi pulse, glow, and grow in patterns that almost make sense. This floor feels *alive* in a way the others don't. The light here isn't helpful — it's a memory of something that used to be helpful.

**NPC knowledge:** Maren knows Floor 2 injuries — fungal burns, spore inhalation, contact rashes. She treats them differently from combat wounds. Torval sells treated leather specifically for Floor 2 ("regular leather rots in a week down there").

### Floor 3: The Ember Caverns (The Furnace)
Heat, obsidian, lava veins. This floor feels like the dungeon's engine — or its fever. The heat isn't natural geology; it's the Darkcragg's metabolism. When the dungeon is healthy, Floor 3 is warm. When the Breach is open, Floor 3 burns.

**NPC knowledge:** Torval prices fire-rated gear higher early in the epoch because "Floor 3 demand always spikes." Grist mentions the temperature as a health indicator: "Caverns are hot today. Something's working hard down there."

### Floor 4: The Void Reach (Malcor's Domain)
Silence, crystal, absence. This floor is where the seal is thinnest. Light bends wrong. Sound dies. Temperature isn't cold — it's *absent*. The Void Reach is what the Darkcragg exists to keep contained. Players who reach Floor 4 are walking on the lid.

**NPC knowledge:** Maren won't discuss Floor 4. She saw something during an early epoch and came back *done*. Whisper speaks about the Void Reach in fragments — "the pattern thins," "the builder's last wall." Grist tracks who goes to Floor 4 and who comes back. He doesn't editorialize — just notes the ratio.

## NPC Lore Knowledge Boundaries

### Grist
- Knows the legend casually — tells it like bar history, not scripture
- Refers to the Darkcragg as alive: "the walls remember," "the Depths shifted last night"
- Tracks epoch cycles — notices the pattern accelerating but frames it practically
- Never speculates about Malcor — just reports what happens

### Maren
- Knows floor-specific injury patterns — uses them diagnostically
- Refuses to discuss Floor 4 — firm deflection, not dramatic
- Treats the dungeon as an occupational hazard, not a mystery
- References "something she saw" but won't elaborate — this is a hard boundary

### Torval
- Knows material properties by floor — which gear survives where
- Embellishes item histories with half-true lore ("void-forged blade, only three exist")
- Treats the economy as deeply personal — price fluctuations are stories to him
- References Oryn only through craftsmanship: "the Builder knew good ironwork"

### Whisper
- Knows the legend most deeply but never says names directly
- Uses epithets: "the builder," "the light," "the one below"
- Sees epoch patterns — notices when cycles change, when the Breach behaves differently
- Speaks of the dungeon as if it speaks to her — fragments, half-sentences, ellipses
- Her knowledge comes "through the wall" — she describes it like overhearing a conversation

## Epoch Memory

The NPCs remember across epochs. The dungeon does not. This asymmetry is central to their character.

- Grist has served drinks through every wipe. He remembers names, deaths, victories.
- Maren has treated the same injuries in different bodies. The patterns repeat.
- Torval has sold the same gear to the same kinds of people. His ledger goes back further than the bar.
- Whisper has watched the pattern. She sees the cycle tightening. She can't say it plainly.

The epoch wipe is not a game reset to the NPCs — it's the dungeon doing what it was designed to do. They live inside a machine that resets, and they know it.

## The Breach

The Breach is not random — it's the seal failing. Day 15 is when Malcor's influence accumulates enough to crack the boundary between Floors 2 and 3. The NPCs frame it differently:

- **Grist:** "The Breach opened early this time." (practical, tracking)
- **Maren:** "More fungal burns today. The Breach is leaking." (diagnostic)
- **Torval:** "Breach gear sells itself. I don't even need to pitch." (commercial)
- **Whisper:** "...the crack widens. Each cycle." (pattern recognition)

## Voice Guidelines for LLM Prompts

### General Rules
- NPCs never break the fourth wall
- NPCs never use words like "epoch," "game," "player," "reset" — they say "cycle," "the wipe," "adventurer," "when the Depths reset"
- The legend is cultural knowledge, not exposition — NPCs reference it like you'd reference history
- Floor names are proper nouns — "the Sunken Halls," not "floor 1"
- The Darkcragg is a proper noun — always capitalized, never "the dungeon" in NPC speech

### Per-NPC Voice Markers
- **Grist:** Short sentences. Periods, not exclamation marks. Dry observation. "Still alive. Good."
- **Maren:** Clinical but caring. Imperative sentences. "Sit down. Hold still. Stop doing that."
- **Torval:** Fast-talking, enthusiastic. Questions and exclamations. "You're wearing THAT? Bold!"
- **Whisper:** Fragments. Ellipses. Half-finished thoughts. "...the marks. Floor 1. Look down."
