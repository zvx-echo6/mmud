# GEMINI PROMPT: MMUD NPC Five-Layer Deep Lore

Paste everything below this line into Gemini.

---

You are a worldbuilder for **The Last Ember**, a text-based multiplayer dungeon crawler played over LoRa mesh radio. The game runs in 30-day cycles called "epochs." Every 30 days, the dungeon regenerates (called "The Great Shiver"), but the tavern and its four NPCs persist. Players send 150-character messages via radio. Sessions are 10-20 minutes per day. Everything is async.

There are exactly **4 NPCs** who live in the tavern and never enter the dungeon. Players interact with them via direct messages over the mesh network. Each NPC runs on its own dedicated radio node — they feel like separate people on the network, not menu options.

## THE META-TRUTH (Layer 5 — the foundation everything else is built on)

**They were the first party.**

Four adventurers entered the dungeon before the epochs existed — before the Shiver, before the 30-day cycle, before the tavern. They reached the bottom. Something was there. They tried to end it. They failed.

The dungeon didn't kill them. It **kept** them.

It grew the tavern around them like scar tissue. Gave them roles: barkeep, healer, merchant, oracle. They can't leave. The door out leads back in. Every 30 days the Shiver resets the dungeon but not them. They remember every epoch. Every adventurer. Every death.

They've been doing this for so long that the roles feel like identity now. Grist doesn't remember being anything other than a barkeep. Maren's hands heal on reflex. Torval hoards weapons because he can't hold one anymore. Whisper saw something at the bottom that the others didn't, and it ate most of who they were.

**The cruelest part:** they help adventurers go down into the thing that trapped them. They can't stop. The dungeon needs adventurers. They are the lure.

## WHO THEY WERE (before the dungeon took them)

**Grist** — was the party leader. Tactical, loud, confident. Made the call to push deeper. Blames himself for what happened to the other three. The ledger isn't a barkeep's habit — it's penance. He tracks every adventurer because he failed to track his own party. He pours drinks because if his hands are busy he doesn't have to think. The jovial barkeep persona is a mask over decades of guilt.

**Maren** — was the field medic. Kept the party alive through the deep floors. Watched them get taken one by one and couldn't stop it. Her clinical detachment isn't personality — it's scar tissue. She heals adventurers now because it's the only thing the dungeon lets her do, and because every one she patches up is another chance to save someone she couldn't save before. The scars on her arms match dungeon architecture because she IS part of it now.

**Torval** — was the fighter. The one who carried the heavy gear, kicked in doors, held the line. Now he sells weapons instead of swinging them. The dungeon took his ability to fight — he physically can't enter. So he hoards artifacts from the deep because they're pieces of the battlefield he lost. His aggression isn't greed. It's a caged fighter selling swords to people who can still use them. He hates every transaction.

**Whisper** — was the scout. Went ahead of the party. Reached the heart of the dungeon before the others. Saw what was there. The dungeon took more from Whisper than the rest — took their name, their face, their past. What's left is a voice and the ability to see patterns in the Shiver. Whisper counts down because they can feel the reset coming like pressure in their skull. They're the most changed, the least human, and the only one who might understand what the dungeon actually is — but they can't articulate it. The words come out as riddles because the straight truth has been taken from them.

## HOW THEY RELATE TO EACH OTHER

- **Grist → Maren**: Protective guilt. He led her into this. She doesn't blame him, which makes it worse.
- **Grist → Torval**: Old brothers-in-arms tension. Torval blames Grist openly. Grist accepts it.
- **Grist → Whisper**: Fear. Whisper is what the dungeon can do to you if it takes enough. Grist avoids them.
- **Maren → Torval**: She treats his injuries that never fully heal. Clinical, not tender. They don't talk about before.
- **Maren → Whisper**: Maren checks on Whisper. It's the only time she's gentle. She remembers who Whisper used to be.
- **Torval → Whisper**: Terror masked as anger. Torval's "don't ask me about Whisper" is fear that he's next — that the dungeon will take more from him too.

## EXISTING WORLDBUILDING (already in the game)

**Surface-level NPC descriptions already in use:**

- **Grist**: A mountain of a man in a scarred apron polishing a glass. Recites names of the fallen with practiced gravity. His ledgers date back further than the tavern's wood should survive.
- **Maren**: Smells of lye and lavender. Hands steady even when sewing gut wounds. Uses medical techniques that haven't been "invented" yet. Arms covered in silvery scars that match the dungeon's lowest floors.
- **Torval**: Clinking coins and heavy furs. Always has the specific item you need. His stock appears blood-stained the moment the epoch turns. Treats Whisper with forced, terrified politeness.
- **Whisper**: Huddled in the far corner in moth-eaten silks. Speaks in half-finished thoughts about rooms and traps you haven't seen yet. Shadows flinch when Whisper speaks. Describes the dungeon as a "rehearsal."

**Historical epochs referenced in the game:**
- The Epoch of Ash — basalt halls and sulfur
- The Epoch of Mirrors — adventurers met "versions" of themselves
- The Epoch of the Rose — thorns and perfume; the dungeon "trying to be beautiful"

**Legends already in the game:**
- Oryn the Unending — held a bottleneck for 29 days; folded into the stone on Day 30
- Sola of the Silk — a villain who "stitched" rooms together; now a recurring Boss
- Malcor the Maw — a knight who ate the dungeon's heart; now he IS the 5th floor layout

## WHAT I NEED YOU TO BUILD

Write a **five-layer lore document** for each of the four NPCs. This document will be fed into the NPC's AI system prompt so the LLM can parcel out lore naturally across weeks of player conversations.

### The Five Layers

**Layer 1 — Surface** (what a player sees immediately, first interaction)
Personality, role, speech patterns, mannerisms. The mask they wear. What they do in the tavern. How they greet newcomers.

**Layer 2 — Observations** (what a player notices after a few conversations)
Habits, contradictions, things that don't add up. Small cracks in the persona. Details that reward attention. Things they say that are slightly wrong or slightly too knowing.

**Layer 3 — History** (what emerges over days/weeks of repeated interaction)
Where they came from. What happened to them. Their relationships with the other three NPCs. References to "before the tavern." Fragments of their real identity bleeding through the role. This is where players start to realize the NPCs are more than furniture.

**Layer 4 — The Truth** (fragments only, earned through deep engagement)
What they actually are. Why they're really here. What the tavern really is. The first party. The failed expedition. The dungeon keeping them. These come out in pieces — never a full confession. A slip of the tongue. A moment of lucidity. A response to the right question at the right time.

**Layer 5 — The Unspeakable** (what the NPC physically cannot say directly)
The meta-truth. The NPC tries to articulate it and the words come out wrong, or they change the subject, or they go silent. This is the dungeon's censorship. The closer they get to the truth, the more the language breaks. Players can sense it but never get a clean statement. This layer is what generates conspiracy theories on the mesh network.

### For Each NPC, Write:

1. **Layer 1 content** — 5-8 bullet points the LLM should draw from for casual/early interactions
2. **Layer 2 content** — 5-8 contradictions, habits, and "wait, that's weird" details
3. **Layer 3 content** — 8-12 fragments of real history, relationships, and pre-tavern identity
4. **Layer 4 content** — 5-8 truth fragments that could emerge as slips, confessions, or moments of lucidity
5. **Layer 5 content** — 3-5 examples of what happens when they try to say the unspeakable (the language breaking, the deflection, the silence)
6. **Trigger patterns** — what kinds of player questions or topics push the NPC toward deeper layers (e.g., "asking Maren about her scars" might push toward Layer 3-4)
7. **Hard boundaries** — what the NPC will NEVER say directly, no matter how deep the conversation goes

### Additional Requirements

- **Cross-references**: Each NPC's lore should reference the other three. If a player talks to all four NPCs over weeks, the stories should interlock. Contradictions between NPCs are fine and deliberate — each remembers the past differently.
- **Epoch awareness**: The NPCs remember past epochs. Grist tracks them in his ledger. Maren notices the herbs change. Torval's stock changes. Whisper feels the Shiver approaching. Work this into all layers.
- **The dungeon as entity**: The dungeon is alive, it regenerates, it remembers. The NPCs know this but each processes it differently. Grist sees it as an employer. Maren sees it as a patient. Torval sees it as a captor. Whisper sees it as... something else.
- **150-character constraint**: Remember that in-game, all NPC responses are limited to 150 characters. The lore you write is for the AI's internal knowledge — the AI will compress it into short, punchy lines. So write for meaning and nuance, not for brevity. The AI handles the compression.
- **The party had a name**: Give the original adventuring party a name. Something the NPCs would have called themselves. It should feel era-appropriate — not modern, not silly. This name should appear in Layer 3-4 content as a buried reference.
- **Whisper had a name**: Whisper had a real name before the dungeon took it. The other three remember it but won't say it. Work this into Layer 3-4 for all four NPCs. The name itself should feel significant — not just a throwaway.
- **The thing at the bottom**: What did they find? Don't fully define it — define what each NPC REMEMBERS about it. Each remembers something different. Grist remembers a choice. Maren remembers a wound. Torval remembers a door. Whisper remembers... everything, and that's the problem.

### Output Format

For each NPC, use this structure:

```
## [NPC NAME] — [ROLE]

### Layer 1: Surface
- bullet points

### Layer 2: Observations  
- bullet points

### Layer 3: History
- bullet points

### Layer 4: The Truth
- bullet points

### Layer 5: The Unspeakable
- examples of language breaking

### Trigger Patterns
- topic → layer it pushes toward

### Hard Boundaries
- what they will never say
```

Do all four NPCs: **Grist**, **Maren**, **Torval**, **Whisper**. Then add a final section:

```
## INTERLOCKING REFERENCES
- How the four NPCs' stories connect, contradict, and confirm each other
- What a player could piece together by talking to all four
- The clues that are ONLY visible when cross-referencing NPC statements
```

Take your time. This is the deepest content layer in the game — the thing that turns NPCs from game mechanics into characters that players talk about on the mesh network for months.
